# Spec: `run_agent()`

**File:** `agent.py`
**Status:** Partially pre-filled — complete the two blank fields before implementing

---

## Purpose

Orchestrate a single conversational turn for the Plant Advisor agent. Given a user message and the conversation history, call the LLM with available tools, execute any tool calls the LLM requests, and return the final text response.

This is the core of what makes Plant Advisor an *agent* rather than a simple chatbot: the ability to decide which tools to call, use their results to inform its response, and loop until it has everything it needs.

---

## Input / Output Contract

**Inputs:**

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `user_message` | `str` | The user's current message |
| `history` | `list` | Gradio conversation history — list of `{"role": ..., "content": ...}` message dicts |

**Output:** `str`

The agent's final text response for this turn. Should never be empty — if something goes wrong, return a user-readable fallback message.

## Design Decisions

*Read `specs/system-design.md` (especially the "How the Groq Tool Calling API Works" section) before reviewing these. Complete the two blank fields before writing any code.*

---

### Messages list structure

The messages list must start with the system prompt, then replay the conversation
history, then add the new user message. The app creates its chat UI with
`type="messages"`, so Gradio history arrives as a list of API-format dicts with
`role` and `content` keys. Gradio may include extra keys (like `metadata`), so
copy only the two fields the API expects:

```python
messages = [{"role": "system", "content": SYSTEM_PROMPT}]

for msg in history:
    messages.append({"role": msg["role"], "content": msg["content"]})

messages.append({"role": "user", "content": user_message})
```

---

### Initial LLM call

Pass the model, the messages list, the tool definitions, and `tool_choice="auto"`
so the LLM can decide whether to call a tool or respond directly:

```python
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model=LLM_MODEL,
    messages=messages,
    tools=TOOL_DEFINITIONS,
    tool_choice="auto",
)
```

---

### Detecting tool calls in the response

The response object has a `choices` list. Index 0 gives the assistant message.
Check its `tool_calls` attribute — if it's truthy, the LLM wants to call tools:

```python
assistant_message = response.choices[0].message

if not assistant_message.tool_calls:
    # No tool calls — LLM has a final answer
    ...
```

---

### Appending the assistant message

When there are tool calls, append the full assistant message object to `messages`
**before** appending any tool results. The API requires this ordering — a tool
result message must immediately follow the assistant message that requested it:

```python
messages.append(assistant_message)  # must come first
```

---

### Executing and appending tool results

For each tool call, extract the name and arguments, call `dispatch_tool()`, and
append the result as a `"tool"` role message. The `tool_call_id` links this result
back to the specific tool call that requested it.

⚠️ For a no-argument tool call (like `get_seasonal_conditions` with no season),
the model may send `arguments` as the JSON string `"null"` — `json.loads` turns
that into `None`, not `{}`. Normalize before dispatching:

```python
for tool_call in assistant_message.tool_calls:
    tool_name = tool_call.function.name
    raw_args = tool_call.function.arguments
    tool_args = json.loads(raw_args) if raw_args else {}
    if not isinstance(tool_args, dict):
        tool_args = {}
    tool_result = dispatch_tool(tool_name, tool_args)

    messages.append({
        "role": "tool",
        "tool_call_id": tool_call.id,
        "content": tool_result,
    })
```

---

### Loop termination conditions

*The loop should stop when: (a) the LLM returns a response with no tool calls, OR (b) the MAX_TOOL_ROUNDS limit is reached. Describe how you will detect each condition and what you will return in each case.*

```
A. The LLM returns a response with no tool calls.
    We can do this by checking if there are any tool calls first in "Detecting tool calls in response" (if not assistant_message.tool_calls). If there are no tool calls, then we can append and return the final message to "messages". If there are tool calls, then we have to make sure that when the tool returns the message, there are no more tool calls after that. If there are, then we have to use a loop continuously until there are no more tool calls.

B. the MAX_TOOL_ROUNDS limit is reached.
    We can detect this limit each time we loop a tool call. What this means is that every time we call a tool, we increment a counter and continue until it reaches the limit. Once the limit is reached, if we are unable to reach a decisive answer, we return a statement such as "unable to find the plant".
```

---

### Extracting the final text response

*Once the loop exits because there are no more tool calls, how do you extract the text content from the response object? What field holds the string you should return?*

```
We extract the text content by checking assistant_message. This field should hold the response the LLM created using the tools provided. 
```

## Implementation Notes

*Fill this in after implementing and testing.*

**Trace of a working agent turn (what tools were called and in what order):**

```
Query: "How should I care for my calathea?"
Round 1 tool call: lookup_plant({'plant_name': 'calathea'})
Round 2 tool call: get_seasonal_conditions({})
Final response: According to the care data for your calathea, you should keep the soil consistently moist but not soggy, and use filtered, distilled, or rainwater to prevent brown edges. The plant prefers indirect or filtered light and requires high humidity (50%+). It's also sensitive to cold drafts and temperatures below 55°F.

In the current season (summer), it's essential to increase humidity, water consistently, and keep the plant out of direct sun. You can fertilize your calathea monthly with a diluted balanced fertilizer during the growing season.

Some common issues to watch out for include brown leaf edges from tap water minerals or dry air, leaf curling from underwatering or low humidity, and yellowing from overwatering. Remember to check the soil every few days, as the hot weather and air conditioning can dry the soil faster.

If you have any further questions or concerns, feel free to ask.
```

**What happens when you ask about a plant that isn't in the database?**

```
It mentions "couldn't find any information on a houseplant named "***".
```

**One thing about the tool call API that surprised you:**

```
Its able to determine the actual month without me giving it!
```
